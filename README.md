# Educational Malware Exploration

## Overview

This repository is created for educational purposes only. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of low-level mechanics and reverse engineering techniques. The project involves the creation of a simple malware-like application for Windows systems.

**Disclaimer: This project should be used in a controlled and isolated environment. Do not use or distribute this code for malicious purposes. The author is not responsible for any misuse of the information provided.**

## Purpose

The educational malware in this repository is designed to serve as a learning tool for:

- Understanding [Windows API calls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and system interactions.
- Exploring reverse engineering techniques.
- Gaining insights into malware detection and analysis.

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Use a dedicated and isolated environment for testing.
   - Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.
   
2. **Compilation:**
   - The code can be compiled using [compiler_name]. Example: `gcc -o malware.exe malware.c` or just use the `make.bat` file in folder 

3. **Execution:**
   - Run the executable in a controlled environment for analysis. I personnaly use [Flare VM project](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) as secure env for dev
